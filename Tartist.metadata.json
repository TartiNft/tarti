    "description": "Tartists are NFTs that create NFTs. When you own a Tartist, you get automatic ownership of any art created by them. The art they create are called TARTIs and they are NFTs too. Tartist bots can do anything, but right now their focus is on making music for demonstartion purposes. Each TARTI will include an mp3 of a completely original musical production uniuqe to your Tartist's style.  Unlike most NFTs, when you mint a TARTIST *you* will control the parameters and your bot will be dynamically created (aka born) at your command.",
