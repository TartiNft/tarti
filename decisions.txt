- file pathing uris ipns all that shit
Stuck on this forever. Shold I use a folder with regiular file names and crerate new folders each time and use IPNS to repoint?
Or should I just update the token URI after creating the media. <-- this is what I finally decided
Factors in my choice:
- Easy to do in Pinata without my own Node
- My conern of using the hash in the url is no biggie as the main pinata example does exactly that (although they do it at mint time)
- Drawback: Its gonna cost me each time
Shit I actually prefer the other method. Its cooler. Lets use use trait.eth. 
Looked again.. its just too much hassle.. Back to same decision. We will use CIds and set after mint.

- Ethereum Solana or Polygon
Decided on Ethereum, as it looks like Eth2 and future sharding etc will continue to improve
ethereum. Also ethereum is just taken a bit more serious. Very possible eth2 optimizations
kill matic and sol. 

- the whole infra thing for the backend services
Lets say we have two services. 
One for creating music and one for handling blockchain events.
When the block chain event handler gets an event he will queue it.
The worker will create art from that queued item using the music service.
The music service will take many minutes to handle a call so it needs to be async.
So the big question becomes, how does the worker get the response?
He could just ask syncronously. To me that makes the most sense... BUT...
if the interface is http, is that a problem? Are we allowed to just wait around for a long running http call?
